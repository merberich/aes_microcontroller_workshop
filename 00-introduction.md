## Brief Overview

### What Are Microcontrollers?

In a sentence: microcontrollers are low-cost, low-level computers designed for use in dedicated applications. We'll present a more formal definition later.

Microcontrollers come in a variety of form factors (called "packages" in-industry) and are typically tiny (on the order of millimeters).
